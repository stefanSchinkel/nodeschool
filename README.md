nodeschool.io (solutions)
-------------------------

Instead of doing katas or sth like that, I decided to do some of the [nodeschool.io workshoppers](http://nodeschool.io/)  Primarily because its good to do basics over and over again and because its **tons of fun** - honestly. I just wanted to do the functional parts and ended up doing the basics too.

For details instruction etc pp see http://nodeschool.io

Here are just the solutions to the ones I did, which currently are:

  * functional-javascript-workshop :arrow_right:`/functional`
  * javascripting :arrow_right: `/js`
  * learnyounode :arrow_right: `/basic`
