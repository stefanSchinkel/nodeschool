nodeschool
----------------

Instead of doing katas or sth like that, 
I do nodeschool. Primarily because its fun.

For details instruction etc pp see http://nodeschool.io

Here are just the solutions to the ones I did, which 
currently are: 

  * javascripting
  * learnyounode
  * functional-javascript-workshop
